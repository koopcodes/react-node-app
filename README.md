# react-node-app
I learned about React at Bloc, and I learned about Node at Bloc, but we didn't put use React and Node together so I thought I should know how. Served on Express of course, and since I used PostgreSQL and Sequlize in previous projects I use MongoDB and Mongoose here so it would be a true **MERN** full-stack app.

Built with:
- **M**ongoDB 4.0.3
- **E**xpress 4.16.4
- **R**eact 16.5.2
- **N**ode 10.12.0
- Webpack 4.21.0
- Redux 4.0.1
- jQuery 3.3.1

Thank you for the help, [Antonio Erdeljac](https://blog.cloudboost.io/@_aerdeljac)!
